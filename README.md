# CPE 487 Final Project

## Expected Behavior
- The frog starts at the bottom center of the screen.
- The frog can move in four directions and must get to the other end of the screen to win, avoiding obstacles along the way.
- The cars are moving obstacles that are in fixed vertical positions on the screen and move horizontally at a set speed.
- The lake is a static obstacle with a bridge in the middle that the frog must cross.
- The frog “dies” if it collides with a car or the lake and the game must be reset.
- There are three coins that the frog can choose to collect along the way to the finish.
- Collecting coins increases the score, which is displayed in binary on the board.
